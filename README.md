The COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM’s Background

The Emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM

The emergence of the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM is out of our deepest concerns on the low-income earner families particularly who were affected by armed conflicts between the gov’t troops and rebel groups, who are living with extended relatives, no permanent house and anywhere in this city and nearby areas, who are classified as low-income earners, with less education and livelihood skills and through series of studies with a group of Professionals and friends from different sectors of society but with one common objective; to help the needy.

PROGRAM SUMMARY

Kambantangan Sa Kapagongaya Peace Advocates, Inc. through its Community Housing and Training (CHT) Program initiates a low-cost housing project for its members in the targeted area at Barangay Tamontaka 5, Cotabato City. The CHT Program will also provide occupational skills training as well as basic educational services and leadership development counseling and propagation of values formation to family members of the organization in order to enhance and to develop their capabilities and skills to augment their family income.

The total budget needed in the amount of PhP 1,704,000.00 for Non-Housing and Administrative Components of the CHT Program will be sourced out to interested Donors, Philanthropists and generous Individuals and Groups. We anticipate the said assistance from the prospective Donors which will be an essential and primary part of our program and will add training and educational component to the program that permits us to both extend our efforts in the field of counseling, training and propagation of values formation.

VISION for the COMMUNITY HOUSING AND TRAINING (CHT) PROGRAM:

The program which we envision is multifaceted (means having a variety of different and important feature or elements), comprehensive (something that includes everything that is needed or relevant) and innovative (something that is new and original. Programs which are more innovative than those of their competitions. Introduces changes and new ideas). The organization has identified appropriate sites for building housing units as a component of this program.

The Housing Component  will provide aid not only to those families requiring assisted housing but also to those families who are direct beneficiaries of non-housing component of the CHT program. We anticipate that percentage of the units will be set aside for school buildings, values formation center and multi-purpose center and office.

PROJECT DESCRIPTION

The project calls for the ACQUISITION OF LAND WITH THE PROVISION OF LOW-COST HOUSING for the NINETY SIX (96) member-families of the organization, all of them are classified as among the “LOW-INCOME earners or the poor.”

Prioritization of Needs

The LAND – The organization has identified the problem of land acquisition as its PRIORITY. The land where this is being settled is already acquired by the organization. With a total land area of 20,000 square meters, 14,000 square meters will be allotted for housing. This represents 70% of the total land area. The other 30% of the land or 6,000 square meters is for roads, parks or open space as required by law and multi-purpose center, values formation center and school buildings.

The DWELLING UNITS. The construction of dwelling units for the members is the second priority need of the organization. Considering the lack of funds, the members, however, could temporarily make use of already available materials for the construction of their temporary dwelling units, while the organization is seeking out for the construction costs of the housing project to interested donors, philanthropists and generous individuals or groups. 

Moreover, the organization is committed to shoulder the administrative costs and expenses, examples; survey cost, titling and registration, taxes and regulatory fees.

Nevertheless, if ever funds would be available, the organization is willing to shoulder the labor cost in the construction of the houses.

The organization is contemplating on the MEDIUM-RISE HOUSING MODEL (One Storey Residential Building). The model has an estimated minimum construction cost of ONE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PESOS (P150, 000.00).

TARGET POPULATION

The target population for CHT Program is the conflict affected families most economically, occupationally and educationally disadvantaged. 

EXPECTED RESULTS OF THE CHT Program

A.	Job Placement and Post-Graduation Follow-up

The CHT Program will offer participants a solid cognitive, developmental, and experiential foundation for future life and work. However, livelihood/occupational training and education require substantive follow-up of job placement and continuing counseling services for program graduates.

B.	Program Linkages

The organization will form a partnerships and alliances with other organizations and agencies and a variety of groups and programs.

The organization will venture significant linkages with the prospective partners.

PROGRAM COST

Donations will be used for the Non-Housing and Housing components of the program. We anticipate that 96 head-families or more or less 384 individuals will be served in the year long program. 

The programs’ administrative cost will be about less or 15 percent of the grant project.

The Non-Housing component costs in the amount of P 1,704,000.00 include salaries, staff, trainee stipends and wages, liability insurance, legal expenses, recruitment costs and materials for training and education.

Administrative costs include all of the appropriate financial and program reporting requirements, accounting and auditing costs, payroll and secretarial work and other administrative costs.

The Housing component program costs will be sourced out to generous individuals and groups, philanthropists, aid organizations, foundations or charitable institutions.

The 2-hectare land area for housing project of the CHT Program is already acquired by the organization on November 2015 through the voluntary contributions of the KKPAI-CHT Program Officers and local supporters.

What the CHT Program is looking for in the form of solicitation appeal is the funds for the construction of the dwelling units.
Although we have friends support the program but due to the cumulative effect of the economy, we are unable to secure the essential funding for the construction of the dwelling units.

With this, the CHT Program is appealing for generous hearts for financial assistance and support so that the program’s vision be realized as an instrument in bridging the opportunities to the needy and less privilege sectors of the society.

So that CHT Program could HELP the dignity of the poor homeless families.

So that CHT Program SAVES the children and youth from the threats of exploitation.

So that we can GIVE A NEW HOPE for a brighter future for children and their families.
